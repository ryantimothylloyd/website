<h3>α-induction Revisited</h3>

<p>The process known as α-induction, developed by Böckenhauer and Evans, may be
thought of as a procedure that accepts the annular partition function of a boundary
conformal field theory (CFT) and produces a toroidal partition function of a closed CFT.
However it is stated and proved in the operator algebraic context. </p>

<p>It is well known that the category of representations of the vertex operator algebra
associated to a CFT is a modular tensor category (MTC). The data of an annular partition
function can be given as a module category over this MTC. Ostrik rephrased α-induction using this categorical language. </p>

<p>In my talk I will first introduce the tube category. This is a categorical analogue of the
tube algebra, introduced in the operator algebraic context by Ocneanu. I will then
explain how Ostrik’s categorical procedure may be reinterpreted as taking the trace of
the module category and extending the result to the tube category. Finally I will describe
how the required properties of a toroidal partition function (e.g. modular invariance)
naturally arise from this perspective. </p>
